# Template for TOPS modules

This template repository provides a base folder structure, and some guidance to help us achieve some consistency across the different modules of the TOPS OpenCore curriculum.

The OpenCore is part of the TOPS mission Area 2: Capacity Sharing. In the first phase, the project is deploying a scalable learning platform, and five learning modules:

1. Ethos of Open Science
2. Tools and Resources
3. Open Data
4. Open Software
5. Open Results

Course curriculum leads will get a link to make a new repository under the GitHub organization [learnopenscience](http://github.com/learnopenscience), with admin permissions granted automatically. 

Next actions:

- change the repository name to the module identifier
- add contributors (subject matter experts) as collaborators
- make a dev branch

Begin developing the content using the folder structure inherited from the template.
