# Template for TOPS modules

This template repository provides a base folder structure, and sample files containing some guidance to help us achieve consistency across the different modules of the TOPS OpenCore curriculum.

The OpenCore is part of the TOPS mission Area 2: Capacity Sharing. In the first phase, the project is deploying a scalable learning platform, and five learning modules:

1. Ethos of Open Science
2. Tools and Resources
3. Open Data
4. Open Software
5. Open Results

Course curriculum leads will get a link to make a new repository under the GitHub organization [learnopenscience](http://github.com/learnopenscience) with the contents of this template reproduced, and admin permissions granted automatically. 

Next actions:

- change the repository name to the module identifier as follows: 
  - TOPS-OC1-ethos
  - TOPS-OC2-tools
  - TOPS-OC3-data
  - TOPS-OC4-code
  - TOPS-OC5-results

- add contributors (subject matter experts) as collaborators
- begin replacing the sample content in the lesson files with your own material

You can create more files to add more sections to the module. Use one file per section, beginning with a top heading (using `#`), and add sub-headings (with `##` and `###`) as needed. These will be used automatically to build the table of contents.
