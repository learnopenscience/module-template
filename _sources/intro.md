# TOPS Core Curriculum Module 1: Ethos of Open Science

The module's introductory content goes here. Replace this template text by a short description of the context and content of the module, and welcome learners to the experience. Add any guidance you think learners need to navigate the content. 

The content of the module is built from a collection of Markdown files (`.md`). You can also use Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) if you wish.
The structure of the module is set by listing the files in order in the `_toc.yml` file, under the `chapters` heading. You can follow the example provided by this template and edit the file list as the content develops.


The `intro.md` file (this file) is the "root" of the module content, with the rest of the content written as separate files, e.g., one file per lesson (or section). Use a top-level heading (starting with one `#`) at the start of each file. Add subsections using `##` and `###` in the lesson files, but not in this `intro.md` file.

A table of contents will be added automatically using the directive:

````
```{tableofcontents}
```
````

```{tableofcontents}
```
