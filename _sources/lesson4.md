# Lesson 4: Self checks, assessments, and activities

Course creators will design self checks, assessments, and activities  for their modules. Self checks can be brief pause points in the learning sequence with prompts to recall recently discussed concepts, tools or methods. The prompt can be as simple as “Pause for a moment and think about...” or they can be short multiple-choice quizzes. The self-checks are not “graded” in the online course, meaning that no points are assigned to them. If they are multiple-choice questions, the correct answer can be displayed after the learner’s attempt. 

Assessments can also be multiple-choice questions, but this time they are “graded” in an online course. Each module needs a few graded assessments, aligned with the learning objectives and the content, as presented. The modules will award a badge to learners that complete the assessments above a threshold score.

Activities can be guided mini-projects for the learners to carry out on their own, perhaps after finishing a module, or a set of tasks to complete while guided by an instructor at an in-person event. We strongly encourage course creators to design a handful of activities for each module. You can explain in writing the activities for the learners, and you can provide a brief description for instructors to have some ideas about how to facilitate the activities in person.

Two principles of pedagogy are relevant to this guidance:

1. **Retrieval practice** — refers to regularly interleaving learning activities with opportunities to recall from our memory what we have learned, as a strategy for long-term learning (sometimes called “testing effect”). Education research has accumulated ample evidence for the effectiveness of retrieval practice, and even simple and obvious fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice questions at frequent intervals can enhance long-term retention {cite:p}`agarwal2021retrieval`.
2. **Constructive alignment** — combines the learning theory of constructivism (that learners construct their knowledge or create meaning from active participation), and the design principle of alignment (that content and assessments should be aligned with learning objectives). Instructional designers often champion the idea of starting with defining learning objectives (known as backward design), but in practice course creation is often an iterative process. Do not become obsessed with learning objectives, but do keep in mind the principle of alignment.

## How to make multiple-choice questions for Open edX

You can craft simple multiple-choice questions to supplement video or written content. In this case, please provide them to the TOPS Curriculum team (separately to the module content) using this markdown format, so we can embed them in the course:

```
>>Statement of the question <<

( ) wrong answer
(x) right answer
( ) wrong answer
