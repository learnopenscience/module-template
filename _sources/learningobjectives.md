# Learning Objectives

Each module needs to have learning objectives, a list of 3 to 5 expected new skills or behaviors for the learners who complete the module.

For example, the module on Ethos of Open Science can have as one learning objective:

- Communicate and interpret the benefits and barriers of Open Science both individually and for community

Here, the verbs "communicate" and "interpret" represent new capacities that learners gain from experiencing the module through its content and activities.

Some people like to use the so-called [SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) to guide drafting of learning objectives.
It is a mnemonic for *specific*, *measurable*, *achievable*, *relevant*, and *time-bound*.
Most important is to focus on the learners (not the content): what will they be able to do differently after completing the module?
