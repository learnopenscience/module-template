# Lesson 3: Anatomy of a module

Each module has an introduction (in the `intro.md` file), learning objectives, written lessons, references, videos and knowledge checks and assessments. 
Use this template repository to fill in the written content. 

Suppose the module has 5 lessons, each designed for 30 minutes of learning time. There are 4,500 words in a 30-minute speech, so you might use that as an upper bound for the written content of each lesson. It should be shorter than that when you add a short video and an assessment or activity.

Here is one possible lesson structure:

- 2,500 to 3,000 words of written content
- 5-min video
- 5 minutes estimated time in a recall activity
