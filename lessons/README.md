# notebooks

Place your content in Jupyter notebooks here. 

Use a **naming convention** where each notebook file starts with a number, reflecting the order of the lessons in the tutorial. Example:

- `1_intro.ipynb`
- `2_basics.ipynb`
- `3_advancedtopics.ipynb`
- `4_keeplearning.ipynb`

List all notebooks in this README, with the file name, and the top-level heading of the content.

Add any Python package dependencies to the requirements.txt in the parent directory.


**Recommend** all notebooks be shared under a dual license: [BSD-3](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) or [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license for code, and [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) license for text and media.

**Recommend** GitHub actions are added to test that dependencies install and notebooks can execute successful.
